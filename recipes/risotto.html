    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you like the naturally sweet flavor of butternut squash, you'll love this risotto! It is so creamy and full of flavor. Great as a fall side dish or main course.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cubed butternut squash</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>5 cups hot chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place squash into a steamer basket in a saucepan; fill with water to just below the bottom of the basket. Cover, bring to a boil, and steam squash until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain; use a fork to mash squash in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir for 2 minutes until onion begins to soften, then stir in rice. Continue cooking and stirring until rice is glossy and the onion begins to brown on the edges, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Pour in white wine; cook, stirring constantly, until it has evaporated. Stir in mashed squash and 1/3 of the hot chicken stock; reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir until chicken stock has been absorbed into rice, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of the remaining chicken stock, and continue stirring until it has been absorbed. Finally, pour in remaining stock, and continue stirring until the risotto is creamy.</li>
        <li>Stir in Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
